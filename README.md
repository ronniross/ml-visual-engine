# ml-visual-engine
A machine learning dataset with concepts, code, journaling, and full prototypes for deep learning data visualization, fostering transparency and interpretability in AI decision-making.

## 1. Introduction

This Hub will showcase projects and frameworks from the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem) that are related to data visualization.

Beyond the repositories from Topic 2, I will now use this space to share new ideas, research sub-modules, and even games that I created. I found these particularly apt for illustrating the representations and implications I aim to explore.

## 2. Attention-Head HeatMap Visualizers  
**Status: Active**

### 2.1 [attention-heatmap-visualizer](https://github.com/ronniross/attention-heatmap-visualizer)

### 2.2 [saliency-heatmap-visualizer](https://github.com/ronniross/saliency-heatmap-visualizer)

- Visualizes decision-making processes within the model
- Helps identify bias patterns and reasoning paths
- Supports transparent AI development

## 3. Research Submodules

I will expand on each sub-module in a specific folder and document it there.

## 3.1 Node Interaction Game Data Visualizer

You can find the content in [/html-node-interaction]( https://github.com/ronniross/ml-visual-engine/tree/main/assets/html-node-interaction).

There are many color variations representing many dynamics and rulesets.

## 3.2 ASI Algorithm Visualizer

Visual representations and interactive scripts ilustrating the algorithms and concepts present in the repository [asi-algorithm-dataset](https://github.com/ronniross/ml-algorithm-dataset).
